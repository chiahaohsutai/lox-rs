# Lox-rs

Implementation of Lox from Robert Nystrom's book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) using Rust. This projects follows each chapter in the book but instead of using Java and C, it implements Lox using Rust instead. The project also focuses on using Rust patterns instead of common programming patterns that belong to Java and C.
