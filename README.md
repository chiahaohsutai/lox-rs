# Lox-rs

**lox-rs** is a Rust implementation of JLox from <i>Crafting Interpreters</i> by Robert Nystrom. The original is written in Java, but I’m rewriting it in Rust to learn more about language implementation and to improve my Rust skills.

I initially tried to build this on my own, but I got stuck—mostly due to lifetime issues and some poor design decisions early on. So I decided to start over and follow Jon Gjengset’s Lox series to better understand how an experienced Rust developer approaches a project like this.

My main goal is to get more comfortable with Rust’s ownership model, lifetimes, and idiomatic design patterns, while also learning how interpreters work under the hood.
